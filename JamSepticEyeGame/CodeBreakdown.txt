- GAME1.CS
    -> MapBuilder mapBuilder
    - Initialize()
        - from framework, make a viewport, this will be the camera and will allow for camera movement in game
    - LoadContent()
        - JairLib.GLOBALS.Load()
            - Creates TileMaps for objects/player and the Map of the game
            - creates 2 usable atlas' (framework named collection) so that references to the tilemap can be numeric
            - loads font, instantiates the *tileSpaces* List
            - instantiates player (uses index 10 from the atlas)
            - QUESTSYSTEM.SetFirstQuestAsCurrent()
                - handles JSON deserialization 
            -> instantiates MapBuilder()
    - Update()
        - JairLib.GLOBALS.Update()
            - gets keyboard input
        - JairLib.player.Update()
            - handles player movement
        - JairLib.CamMove()
            - handles the camera positioning
        - JairLib.QuestSystem.Update()
            -SideObjectives
                - checks interaction
                - to get 'real' ending, remove the 2 invisible side objective triggers 
            - checks if all main objectives are complete
            -MainObjectives
                - checks interaction for each main objective, definitely should refactor
        - handles shader
    - Draw(): order is important, good to know for the future the order that the function works to 
                have layering in future games; to keep things tidy, each class should have it's own
                draw method, in case anything should go along with it and so that it does not 
                clutter the main game function 
        -> DRAW TILEMAP (TOPMOST)
        -> PLAYER
        -> OBJECTS
        -> OBJECT TEXT
        -> UI
        -> SHADER (TOPMOST)

- MapBuilder
    - Constructor
        - handles the csv and populates the List<TileSpace> Spaces with the map data and correlating texture and rectangle position
    - DrawMapFromList()
        - draws the map column by column (this was a headache to figure out)
- Globals
    - Loads spritesheets, updates keyboard and camera movement
- JairIObject   (Custom interfaces and enums)
    - ITileObject, this was mainly used over the IJairObject because of Texture2DRegion vs Texture2D
- KeyObjective
    - this is the class that the json data should be formatted after
    - IsCompletedFlag is essentially a flag to toggle KeyObjectives
- Quest
    - Quest Class
        - Id
        - main quest objectives
            -starting
            -middle
            -ending
        - side objectives (making a list is much neater and will probably end up being how i refactor the main quests)
    - QuestSystem static class
        - checks if the KeyObjectives of Quest(s) are complete or not and will have them present text or not based on that data
- Textures
    - handles the textures of the tiles
    - planned to use enum, will iterate on that idea
- TileSpace
    - 3 constructors
        - default
        - index from default Atlas collection
        - index from specific Atlas collection
    - csvValue determines the texture in the atlas whether it is collidable or not (for the future, 
        TileSpace would a base class and each map would have their own, so that the setCollision 
        doesnt mess with separate maps)
    - Update() 
        - checks intersection with player, probably a more efficient way of doing this but i dont know it
